# Welcome to Courier iOS Contribution Guide

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `sh env-setup.sh` from the root directory

From here, you are all set to start working on the package! üôå

## Developing

To make changes to the SDK:
1. Edit code inside of `Sources`

To test the changes in an example:
1. Commit and push your changes to a branch
  - This is the flow needed to test the Swift Package Manager package
2. Open an example project found inside `Examples`
3. In the example project, make sure your Package Dependency is using the branch you are developing on

4. To pull the latest changes from your branch, go to File > Packages > Update to Latest Package Versions

When you need to make a change, you will need to make the change in the `Sources` file, commit and push the change, the Update to Latest Package Verisons.

This is the recommended apple development flow ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
